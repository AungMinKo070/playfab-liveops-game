A sample HTML game to show how PlayFab works

# Game concept

A looter shooter similar to Destiny or The Division.

We won't be supporting multiple characters, so everything will be per-player. We will have stats like number of kills, XP, level, money, locations visited.

We will use title data to store information on planets, enemies, treasure chests.

We will have multiple weapons, different weapon types, stats.

We will have enemies with HP, attack power, defense.

Killing enemies gives you XP and money.

We'll have a home base with vendors that sell weapons and armor and ammo.

The game loop is: shoot enemies to get money to buy more guns to shoot enemies.

Also treasure chests using drop tables.
